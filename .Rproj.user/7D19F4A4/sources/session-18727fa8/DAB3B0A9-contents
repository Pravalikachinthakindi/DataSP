# Introduction

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of data science! In this exploration, we'll dive into the intricacies of Linear Regression using the R programming language. Linear Regression is a powerful tool for predictive modeling, allowing us to understand and forecast relationships between variables.

## The Challenge

Imagine we have a dataset that captures information about student performance. Our goal is to investigate whether the number of hours a student studies correlates with their exam scores. Through the lens of Linear Regression, we aim to build a predictive model to forecast scores based on study hours.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before we begin the coding adventure, let's first take a look at our dataset to understand its characteristics.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Generate a synthetic student performance dataset for illustration purposes
set.seed(123)
student_data <- tibble(
  student_id = 1:100,
  study_hours = rnorm(100, mean = 20, sd = 5),
  exam_scores = rnorm(100, mean = 75, sd = 10)
)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(student_data)

# Visualize the relationship between study hours and exam scores
ggplot(student_data, aes(x = study_hours, y = exam_scores)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Study Hours and Exam Scores", x = "Study Hours", y = "Exam Scores")
# Fit a linear regression model
linear_model <- lm(exam_scores ~ study_hours, data = student_data)

# Display the summary of the linear regression model
summary(linear_model)
